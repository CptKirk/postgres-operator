      <description>Crunchy Data announces the release of the PostgreSQL Operator 4.2.0 on December, 31, 2019.
The focus of the 4.2.0 release of the PostgreSQL Operator was on the resiliency and uptime of the PostgreSQL clusters that the PostgreSQL Operator manages, with an emphasis on high-availability and removing the Operator from being a single-point-of-failure in the HA process. This release introduces support for a distributed-consensus based high-availability approach using Kubernetes distributed consensus store as the backing, which, in other words, allows for the PostgreSQL clusters to manage their own availability and not the PostgreSQL Operator.</description>
