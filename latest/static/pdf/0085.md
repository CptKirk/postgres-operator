Crunchy Data announces the release of PGO, the Postgres Operator 4.7.4.

The PostgreSQL Operator is released in conjunction with the [Crunchy Container Suite](https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/).

PostgreSQL Operator 4.7.4 release includes the following software versions upgrades:

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) versions 13.5, 12.9, 11.14, 10.19 and 9.6.24 are now available.
- [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/) version 3.1.4 is now available.
- The [pgnodemx](https://github.com/CrunchyData/pgnodemx) extension is now at version 1.0.6
- [pgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org/) is now at version 1.16.1
- The [pgAudit](https://github.com/pgaudit/pgaudit) extension is now at version 1.6.1.
- The [pg_partman](https://github.com/pgpartman/pg_partman) extension is now at version 4.6.0.
- The [TimescaleDB](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb) extension is now at version 2.5.0.

## Changes

- Update automatic OpenShift detection logic to look specifically for the presence of the SecurityContextConstraint API. Reported by (@aurelien43).
- The `rmdata` process now verifies the proper deletion of all cluster resources prior to deleting the `pgcluster` custom resource.
- Label updates will now be retried to account for potential race conditions.

## Fixes

- Ensure the `pgo create pgbouncer` command can set CPU and memory limits via `--cpu-limit` and `--memory-limit` respectively.
- Ensure `pgo delete backup` works with backups stored in S3 or GCS. Reported by Munjal Patel (@munjalpatel).
- Ensure `pgo create cluster --pgbackrest-s3-ca-secret` overrides the CA used for pgBackRest.
- Update the `aws-s3-ca.crt` value to use the newer CAs provided by AWS. If a PostgreSQL cluster is using the old default CA, PGO will update the general one kept in the `pgo-backrest-repo-config` Secret and `pgo upgrade` will update it for a specific cluster.
- The `aws-s3-ca.crt` file in a pgBackRest Secret is now properly preserved when recreating a cluster that was previously deleted using the `--keep-backups` flag.
- Fix noise in logs due to an incorrect reference in a shell script when performing a reload operation on a PostgreSQL cluster.
