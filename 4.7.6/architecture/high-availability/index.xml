      <description>Advanced high-availability and disaster recovery strategies involve spreading your database clusters across multiple data centers to help maximize uptime. In Kubernetes, this technique is known as &amp;ldquo;federation&amp;rdquo;. Federated Kubernetes clusters are able to communicate with each other, coordinate changes, and provide resiliency for applications that have high uptime requirements.
As of this writing, federation in Kubernetes is still in ongoing development and is something we monitor with intense interest. As Kubernetes federation continues to mature, we wanted to provide a way to deploy PostgreSQL clusters managed by the PostgreSQL Operator that can span multiple Kubernetes clusters.</description>
