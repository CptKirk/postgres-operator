Crunchy Data announces the release of PGO, the Postgres Operator 4.5.5.

The PostgreSQL Operator is released in conjunction with the [Crunchy Container Suite](https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/).

PostgreSQL Operator 4.5.5 release includes the following software versions upgrades:

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) versions 13.5, 12.9, 11.14, 10.19 and 9.6.24 are now available.
- The [pgnodemx](https://github.com/CrunchyData/pgnodemx) extension is now at version 1.0.6.
- [pgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org/) is now at version 1.16.1

## Changes

- The default `pgo-backrest-repo-config` Secret can now be automatically generated by the Operator. This functionality was backpatched from v4.6 to help support the fix around automatically updating the AWS CA values.

## Fixes

- Ensure the `pgo create pgbouncer` command can set CPU and memory limits via `--cpu-limit` and `--memory-limit` respectively.
- Update the `aws-s3-ca.crt` value to use the newer CAs provided by AWS. If a PostgreSQL cluster is using the old default CA, PGO will update the general one kept in the `pgo-backrest-repo-config` Secret and `pgo upgrade` will update it for a specific cluster.
- Allow for the original primary instance to be scaled down after running `pgo upgrade`.
